<p>Each year, more deaths occur due to flooding than from any other thunderstorm-related hazard. Approximately 75% of all Presidential disaster declarations are associated with flooding.

    The most common cause of flooding is water due to rain that accumulates faster than soils can absorb it or rivers can carry it away. Flooding can occur because of
    
    prolonged rain falling over several days,
    when intense rain falls over a short period of time, or 
    when debris or ice jam causes a river or stream to overflow onto the surrounding area.
    Flooding can also result from the failure of a water control structure, such as a levee or dam.  </p>
